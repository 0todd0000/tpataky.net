	:scale: 50





Overview
-----------------------------------------
These are the MUN104 left- and right- plantar pressure distribution templates, computed from 104 subjects at the University of MÃ¼nster, Germany.

Recommended uses: as a datum for comparisons with individuals and/or other populations.





Data
-----------------------------------------

- :download:`MUN104.h5.zip <./downloads/MUN104.h5.zip>` (for Matlab, Python, C, etc.) 
- :download:`MUN104.csv.zip <./downloads/MUN104.csv.zip>` (for spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel)

Loading and viewing the data (MATLAB)
-----------------------------------------

>>> file_name = 'MUN104L.h5'; 
>>> I = hdf5read(file_name, '/I'); 
>>> I = double( I' ); 
>>> h = pcolor(I); 
>>> set(h, 'facecolor','flat', 'edgecolor','none') 
>>> axis image





Loading and viewing the data (Python)
-----------------------------------------

>>> import tables 
>>> from matplotlib import pyplot 
>>> file_name = 'MUN104L.h5' 
>>> file_id = tables.openFile(file_name, mode='r') 
>>> I = file_id.getNode('/I').read() 
>>> file_id.close() 
>>> pyplot.imshow(I, origin='lower', interpolation='nearest') 
>>> pyplot.show()





Data format
-----------------------------------------
HDF5 is an open data format, excellent for the fast reading-and-writing of large datasets.
